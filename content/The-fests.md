TASK 3 - Static Site Generator
Goal: You have probably heard of Jekyll or Hugo. They are pretty well known static site generators. Most wannabe bloggers use static site generators in order to save on server costs. The task is to create an SSG in the language of your choice, and then host it using any free CI/CD service (Gitlab CI/CD or Github Actions are pretty well regarded). Push all your code to a private GitHub repository and make it public after the deadline. 
Deliverables:
Well documented and readable code. There are brownie parts for modularity. We do not care what language you use. The README should be clear.
An easy-to-understand workflow. Again, look at Hugo, it is stellar.
As many cool features as you can implement. 
Necessary Features:
Generating an index page and posts. Something like this blog should be the bare minimum your SSG can generate.
An RSS feed. 
Support for configuration files.
Cool Features:
Tagging. That would be splendid.
Support for generating multiple blogs at once. 
An API based commenting system like staticman. 
Rudimentary search functionality.

TASK 4 - Infosec
Goal: Your mission is to take down a nefarious hacking group causing chaos in educational institutions in India. But there's a twist â€” inside the group, a member is working undercover, willing to help you bring the hackers to justice.
She's sent you the details of the communication server used by the hackers.
